# Oregon by the Counties


### Introduction
This is a story map that contains a sample of key measures borrowed from the [Oregon by the Numbers 2018 Edition](https://www.tfff.org/select-books/book/oregon-numbers) report.

The sample of key measures are as follows:

- Total Population
- Percentage of Rural population
- Net migration
- Housing Cost burden

These are just a handful of the key measures provided by Oregon by the Numbers to further visualize the data using a dynamic online interface. The goal of Oregon by the Numbers is to get information to local community leaders, to encorage data driven decision making.

This Oregon by the Counties story map further extends the vision by creating an online interactive platform to visualize and analyze the key measures for Oregon counties.
